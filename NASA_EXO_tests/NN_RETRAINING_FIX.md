# Neural Network Retraining Fix

## ✅ **Issue Fixed**

The Neural Network was only being trained on **80%** of the training data during Keras Tuner optimization due to `validation_split=0.2`, while all other models were trained on **100%** of the training data.

---

## 🔧 **What Was Changed**

### Before (Cell 26):
```python
# Get best model
best_nn_model = tuner.get_best_models(num_models=1)[0]  # ❌ Only trained on 80% of data
best_nn_params = tuner.get_best_hyperparameters(num_trials=1)[0]

print("\n✓ Neural Network optimization complete!")
# ... print hyperparameters ...

# Evaluate on test set (immediately)
y_pred_nn_proba = best_nn_model.predict(X_test, verbose=0).flatten()
```

### After (Cell 26):
```python
# Get best hyperparameters
best_nn_params = tuner.get_best_hyperparameters(num_trials=1)[0]

print("\n✓ Neural Network optimization complete!")
# ... print hyperparameters ...

# Retrain on full training set (without validation split)
print("\n📊 Training Neural Network with optimal hyperparameters on full training set...")
best_nn_model = build_nn_model(best_nn_params)

# Train on 100% of training data (no validation split this time)
history = best_nn_model.fit(
    X_train_balanced, y_train_balanced,  # ✅ All 10,252 samples
    epochs=100,
    batch_size=32,
    callbacks=[early_stop],  # Still uses early stopping
    verbose=0
)
print(f"     ✓ Neural Network trained successfully on {X_train_balanced.shape[0]} samples")

# Evaluate on test set
y_pred_nn_proba = best_nn_model.predict(X_test, verbose=0).flatten()
```

| **Random Forest** | 100% of balanced set | 10,252 | ✅ |
| **XGBoost** | 100% of balanced set | 10,252 | ✅ |
| **LightGBM** | 100% of balanced set | 10,252 | ✅ |
| **Neural Network (Old)** | 80% of balanced set | 8,202 | ❌ |

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### Phase 1: Optimization (Lines 1239-1246)
```python
tuner.search(
    X_train_balanced, y_train_balanced,
    epochs=100,
    batch_size=32,
    validation_split=0.2,  # Uses 80% for training, 20% for validation
    callbacks=[early_stop, reduce_lr],
    verbose=0
)
```
- **Purpose**: Find best hyperparameters
- **Training data**: 8,202 samples (80%)
- **Validation data**: 2,050 samples (20%)

### Phase 2: Retraining (Lines 1259-1270 - NEW!)
```python
best_nn_model = build_nn_model(best_nn_params)
history = best_nn_model.fit(
    X_train_balanced, y_train_balanced,
    epochs=100,
    batch_size=32,
    callbacks=[early_stop],  # No validation split
    verbose=0
)
```
- **Purpose**: Train final model with best hyperparameters
- **Training data**: 10,252 samples (100%)
- **Validation data**: None (uses all data for training)

## 📈 **Expected Benefits**

1. **More Training Data**: +2,050 samples (20% increase)
2. **Fair Comparison**: NN now trained on same amount as other models
3. **Better Performance**: Should improve accuracy/F1-score
4. **Consistent Process**: All models follow the same pattern:
   - Optimize → Find best hyperparameters
   - Retrain → Train on full dataset with best parameters

## 🔍 **Output Changes**

When you run Cell 26 now, you'll see:

```
✓ Neural Network optimization complete!

Best hyperparameters:
  Input units: 192
  Number of hidden layers: 1
  Learning rate: 0.004116
  Input dropout: 0.30

📊 Training Neural Network with optimal hyperparameters on full training set...
     ✓ Neural Network trained successfully on 10252 samples  ← NEW!

================================================================================
NEURAL NETWORK PERFORMANCE
================================================================================
  Accuracy:  0.XXXX  (should be better!)
  F1-Macro:  0.XXXX  (should be better!)
  ...
```

## ⚙️ **Technical Details**

### Why This Matters

**Keras Tuner Search Phase**:
- `validation_split=0.2` is needed during optimization
- Allows Keras Tuner to evaluate each trial on held-out data
- Prevents overfitting during hyperparameter search

**Retraining Phase**:
- Once we know the best hyperparameters, we don't need validation
- We want to use ALL available training data
- Early stopping still prevents overfitting (monitors training loss)

### Early Stopping Still Works

Even without validation data, `EarlyStopping` can still:
- Monitor training loss
- Stop if loss plateaus or increases
- Restore best weights
