# Bug Fix Summary - Ridge/Lasso Prediction Error

## üêõ Bug Description

**Error**: `ValueError: Classification metrics can't handle a mix of binary and continuous targets`

**Location**: Cell 20 (Model Comparison section)

**Root Cause**: Ridge and Lasso regression models return **continuous predictions** (e.g., 0.73, 1.24, -0.15) rather than binary classifications (0 or 1). When these continuous values were passed to classification metrics like `accuracy_score()`, `f1_score()`, and `matthews_corrcoef()`, it caused a ValueError.

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### What Changed

**Before (Buggy Code)**:
```python
for model_name, model in optimized_models.items():
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    
    # Handle probability predictions for linear models
    if hasattr(model, 'predict_proba'):
        y_proba = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
    else:
        # For Ridge/Lasso, use decision function or raw predictions
        if hasattr(model, 'decision_function'):
            y_proba = model.decision_function(X_test)
        else:
            y_proba = model.predict(X_test)
    
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)  # ‚ùå FAILS for Ridge/Lasso
    f1_macro = f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average='macro')
    mcc = matthews_corrcoef(y_test, y_pred)
```

**After (Fixed Code)**:
```python
for model_name, model in optimized_models.items():
    # Get raw predictions from model
    y_pred_raw = model.predict(X_test)
    
    # Handle different model types for probability predictions
    if hasattr(model, 'predict_proba'):
        # Tree-based models (RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM) return binary predictions
        y_proba = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
        y_pred = y_pred_raw  # Already binary (0 or 1)
    else:
        # Linear models (Ridge, Lasso) return continuous values
        y_proba = y_pred_raw  # Use raw predictions as probability-like scores
        y_pred = (y_pred_raw > 0.5).astype(int)  # ‚úÖ Convert to binary using threshold
    
    # Calculate classification metrics (all predictions are now binary)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)  # ‚úÖ Now works correctly
    f1_macro = f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average='macro')
    mcc = matthews_corrcoef(y_test, y_pred)
```

### Key Changes

1. **Renamed variable**: `y_pred` ‚Üí `y_pred_raw` to distinguish raw predictions
2. **Added binary conversion**: For Ridge/Lasso models, apply threshold: `(y_pred_raw > 0.5).astype(int)`
3. **Improved comments**: Clarified which models need conversion and why
4. **Preserved functionality**: Tree-based models work exactly as before

## üéØ How It Works Now

### For Tree-Based Models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM):
- `predict()` returns binary values (0 or 1) ‚úÖ
- `predict_proba()` returns probabilities [0.0 to 1.0] ‚úÖ
- No conversion needed

### For Linear Models (Ridge, Lasso):
- `predict()` returns continuous values (e.g., 0.73, 1.24, -0.15) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **FIX**: Convert to binary using threshold > 0.5
  - Values > 0.5 become 1 (EXOPLANET)
  - Values ‚â§ 0.5 become 0 (NOT_EXOPLANET)
- Raw continuous values used as "probability-like scores" for PR-AUC calculation

---

## üìä Impact

### Models Affected
- ‚úÖ **Ridge Regression** - Fixed
- ‚úÖ **Lasso Regression** - Fixed
- ‚úÖ Random Forest - Works as before
- ‚úÖ XGBoost - Works as before
- ‚úÖ LightGBM - Works as before
- ‚úÖ Neural Network - Works as before (if Keras Tuner is installed)

### Backward Compatibility
- ‚úÖ All existing functionality preserved
- ‚úÖ Tree-based models unaffected
- ‚úÖ Model saving/loading unchanged
- ‚úÖ Metrics calculation improved

## üîç Technical Details

### Why This Bug Occurred

Ridge and Lasso are **regression** models adapted for classification:
- They minimize squared error (regression objective)
- They return real-valued outputs (not probabilities)
- For classification, we need to apply a decision threshold

### The Threshold Choice

We use **0.5 as the threshold** because:
1. The training data is balanced 50/50 after SMOTE (class 0 = 5126, class 1 = 5126)
2. Linear models output roughly centered around 0.5 for balanced data
3. This is the standard threshold for binary classification

### Alternative Approaches Considered

‚ùå **Use `predict_proba()`** - Not available for Ridge/Lasso  
‚ùå **Use `decision_function()`** - Ridge doesn't have this method  
‚úÖ **Use threshold on raw predictions** - Simple, effective, interpretable

## ‚úÖ Verification

### Test the Fix

1. Re-run the notebook from the beginning
2. When Cell 20 (Model Comparison) executes, all 6 models should complete successfully
3. You should see output like:

```
Ridge:
  Accuracy:  0.XXXX
  F1-Macro:  0.XXXX
  PR-AUC:    0.XXXX
  MCC:       0.XXXX

Lasso:
  Accuracy:  0.XXXX
  F1-Macro:  0.XXXX
  PR-AUC:    0.XXXX
  MCC:       0.XXXX

RandomForest:
  Accuracy:  0.XXXX
  ...
```

### Expected Behavior

- ‚úÖ No more ValueError
- ‚úÖ Ridge and Lasso models complete evaluation
- ‚úÖ All metrics calculated correctly
- ‚úÖ Model ranking table displays properly

## üì¶ Backup Created

A backup of the original notebook was saved as:
```
notebooks/tess_exoplanet_detection_IMPROVED_working.ipynb.backup
```

You can restore it if needed:
```bash
cp notebooks/tess_exoplanet_detection_IMPROVED_working.ipynb.backup \
   notebooks/tess_exoplanet_detection_IMPROVED_working.ipynb
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Re-run the failing cell** (Cell 20 in the notebook)
2. **Verify all 6 models complete** without errors
3. **Check the model ranking table** at the end
4. **Save all models** using the save cell (Cell 27)
