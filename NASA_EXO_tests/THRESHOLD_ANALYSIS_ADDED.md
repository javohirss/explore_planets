## 📍 **Location**

- **Section**: 10. 🎯 Threshold Analysis & Optimization
- **Cells**: Two new cells added (1 markdown + 1 code)
- **Position**: After cross-validation section, before the final empty cell

## 🎯 **What It Does**

### **1. Threshold Sweep Analysis**
- Tests **101 different thresholds** from 0.0 to 1.0 (increments of 0.01)
- Evaluates **all 6 models** at each threshold
- Calculates comprehensive metrics at each threshold:
  - Accuracy
  - F1-Macro Score
  - Class-specific Recall (for both classes)
  - Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)
  - True Positives, True Negatives
  - False Positives, False Negatives
  - Total Errors

### **2. Four Visualization Charts Per Model**

#### **Chart 1: Accuracy & F1-Macro vs Threshold**
- Shows how overall performance changes with threshold
- Displays both accuracy (blue) and F1-Macro (red) curves
- Marks the optimal F1 threshold (red dashed line)
- Shows default threshold 0.5 (gray dotted line)

#### **Chart 2: Class-Specific Recall vs Threshold**
- Shows recall for **Class 0 (Non-Exoplanet)** in green
- Shows recall for **Class 1 (Exoplanet)** in magenta
- Demonstrates the trade-off between classes
- Lower threshold → Higher Class 1 recall (catch more exoplanets)
- Higher threshold → Higher Class 0 recall (fewer false alarms)

#### **Chart 3: Matthews Correlation Coefficient vs Threshold**
- MCC ranges from -1 to +1 (0 = random, 1 = perfect)
- Best metric for imbalanced datasets
- Marks optimal MCC threshold (orange dashed line)
- Shows where model achieves best balance

#### **Chart 4: Errors vs Threshold**
- False Positives in red (predicted exoplanet, but wasn't)
- False Negatives in blue (missed actual exoplanet)
- Total Errors in purple dashed line
- Shows error trade-off as threshold changes

### **3. Optimal Threshold Identification**
For each model, automatically finds:
- **Optimal threshold for F1-Macro** (best overall balance)
- **Optimal threshold for MCC** (best for imbalanced data)
- **Optimal threshold for Accuracy**
- Comparison with default threshold (0.5)
- F1 improvement over default threshold

### **4. Summary Table**
Displays:
- Model name

---

## 🔍 **Why This Matters**

### **Problem with Default Threshold (0.5)**
- Most classifiers default to 0.5 threshold
- This assumes equal cost for false positives and false negatives
- **For exoplanet detection:**
  - Missing a planet (false negative) might be very costly
  - False alarm (false positive) might be acceptable
  - → Lower threshold might be better!

### **Solution: Threshold Optimization**
- ✅ Find the threshold that maximizes your desired metric
- ✅ Understand trade-offs between precision and recall
- ✅ Adjust threshold based on mission priorities
- ✅ Visualize impact on all error types

---

## 🎓 **Understanding the Charts**

### **Chart 1: Accuracy & F1-Macro**
- **What to look for**: Peak of the curves
- **Interpretation**: 
  - Accuracy often peaks near 0.5
  - F1-Macro might peak at different threshold
  - The gap between curves shows metric disagreement
- **Action**: Use F1-optimal threshold for balanced performance

### **Chart 2: Class-Specific Recall**
- **What to look for**: Crossing point of the curves
- **Interpretation**: 
  - As threshold ↓: Class 1 recall ↑, Class 0 recall ↓
  - As threshold ↑: Class 1 recall ↓, Class 0 recall ↑
  - Shows the fundamental trade-off
- **Action**: Choose based on which class is more important

### **Chart 3: Matthews Correlation Coefficient**
- **What to look for**: Maximum MCC value
- **Interpretation**: 
  - MCC > 0.3 = reasonable performance
  - MCC > 0.5 = good performance
  - MCC peak often near optimal F1 threshold
- **Action**: Use MCC-optimal threshold for imbalanced data

### **Chart 4: Errors**
- **What to look for**: Minimum total errors
- **Interpretation**: 
  - FP decreases as threshold increases
  - FN increases as threshold increases
  - Total errors has a minimum point
- **Action**: Balance FP vs FN based on costs

---

## 📈 **Use Cases**

### **Conservative Discovery (Minimize False Alarms)**
- **Goal**: Only report high-confidence exoplanets
- **Strategy**: Use higher threshold (e.g., 0.6-0.7)
- **Result**: Fewer false positives, but might miss some planets

### **Aggressive Discovery (Maximize Detections)**
- **Goal**: Don't miss any potential exoplanets
- **Strategy**: Use lower threshold (e.g., 0.3-0.4)
- **Result**: Catch more planets, but more false alarms to filter

### **Balanced Approach (Optimize F1)**
- **Goal**: Best overall performance
- **Strategy**: Use F1-optimal threshold (often 0.45-0.52)
- **Result**: Good balance between precision and recall

### **Mission-Critical Reliability (Optimize MCC)**
- **Goal**: Most reliable predictions
- **Strategy**: Use MCC-optimal threshold
- **Result**: Best balance considering all confusion matrix elements

## 🔬 **Technical Details**

### **Threshold Application**
For each model:
- **Ridge/Lasso**: Direct threshold on continuous output
- **Tree Models (RF/XGB/LGB)**: Threshold on `predict_proba()[:, 1]`
- **Neural Network**: Threshold on sigmoid output probabilities

### **Metrics Calculation**
At each threshold:
1. Apply threshold: `y_pred = (y_scores >= threshold).astype(int)`
2. Calculate classification metrics
3. Extract confusion matrix elements
4. Store all results

### **Handling Edge Cases**
- When all predictions are one class (threshold too extreme)
- When recall calculation returns zero-length array
- When confusion matrix is not 2×2
- Graceful handling with `zero_division=0` parameter

---

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **Step 1: Run the Notebook**
Execute all cells up to the threshold analysis section.

### **Step 2: Execute Threshold Analysis**
Run the new cell. This will:
- Take ~1-2 minutes to analyze all thresholds
- Generate 24 charts (4 charts × 6 models)
- Print optimal thresholds for each model

### **Step 3: Examine Charts**
For each model, review all 4 charts:
- Identify optimal thresholds
- Understand trade-offs
- Compare with default (0.5)

### **Step 4: Choose Your Threshold**
Based on your mission priorities:
- **Scientific discovery**: Lower threshold (catch more planets)
- **High confidence**: Higher threshold (fewer false alarms)
- **Publication**: F1-optimal threshold (balanced)
- **Production system**: MCC-optimal threshold (most reliable)

### **Step 5: Apply Threshold**
In your production code:
```python
# Get probabilities
if model_name == 'LightGBM':
    y_proba = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
    
# Apply optimal threshold (example: 0.46)
optimal_threshold = 0.46
y_pred_optimal = (y_proba >= optimal_threshold).astype(int)

# Evaluate with optimal threshold
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_optimal))
```

## 🎨 **Example Interpretation**

If LightGBM's optimal F1 threshold is **0.46** instead of **0.50**:

**What this means:**
- Slightly lower threshold catches more exoplanets
- Small increase in false positives (acceptable)
- F1 score improves from 0.7203 → 0.7289 (+0.86%)
- This improvement could mean **finding ~5-10 more real planets** in your test set!

**Action:**
- Deploy with 0.46 threshold in production
- Document this choice in your paper
- Monitor false positive rate in real data
- Adjust if needed based on follow-up observations
