## 📊 Key Findings

### Current Performance (Your Notebook):
- ✅ Accuracy: **87.8%** (Good!)
- ✅ Exoplanet Recall: **96.8%** (Excellent!)
- ⚠️  False Positive Recall: **43.2%** (Needs improvement!)

2. **Missing Domain Features:** No physics-based features (transit SNR, stellar density, etc.)
3. **Suboptimal Hyperparameters:** Manual selection without optimization
4. **Single Model:** No ensemble methods for robustness
5. **Limited Metrics:** Missing PR-AUC, MCC, Cohen's Kappa

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No module named 'imblearn'"
```bash
pip install imbalanced-learn
```

### Issue: "No module named 'optuna'"
```bash
pip install optuna
```

### Issue: SMOTE fails with "Expected n_neighbors <= n_samples"
```python
# Your minority class is too small, reduce k_neighbors:
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42, k_neighbors=3)  # instead of 5
```

### Issue: Optuna optimization takes too long
```python
# Reduce number of trials:
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=20)  # instead of 50
```

### Issue: Memory error during training
```python
# Reduce ensemble size or use only LightGBM:
# Set use_ensemble=False in prediction function
```
